First, I’d like you to demonstrate that you can do a succinct, focused, substantive comparable companies analysis of the company set you chose and have been working with for the semester. This section should not be more than 1,000 words plus a few tables.

Second, choose one of your companies as a buyer and another as a target and analyze a combination of the two. You will need to rationalize a target price, do a Has Gets analysis that optimizes (not perfectly but enough to show that you understand the issues) the form of consideration and outcomes; cope thoughtfully with the place of synergy estimates in such an analysis (avoid ridiculous plug numbers, they need to make some sense);  and summarize how you would expect  a transaction to be choreographed and evolve (i.e. one step or two step).   Be very clear about the assumptions you make, data sources, and calculations. This is NOT supposed to be a research paper on the industry. Focus on using the tools and knowledge we have developed in the course. Please limit your answers here to 1,250 words. Again, get to the point, avoid fluff, be precise in your use of vocabulary.
