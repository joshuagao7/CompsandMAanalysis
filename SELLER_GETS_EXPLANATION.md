# Seller Gets Calculations - Detailed Explanation

## Overview
**Seller Gets** represents what Lattice Semiconductor shareholders receive in the transaction. Since this is an all-cash deal, they receive cash consideration at the offer price, not equity.

## Step-by-Step Calculations

### 1. **Share Price: $89.19**

**Calculation:**
```
Current Market Price: $68.61
Offer Premium: 30%
Offer Price = Current Price × (1 + Premium)
           = $68.61 × 1.30
           = $89.19
```

**What it means:** Each Lattice shareholder receives $89.19 per share in cash (30% premium over current market price).

---

### 2. **P/E Ratio: 199.58x**

**Calculation:**
```
Lattice EPS: $0.45
Offer Price: $89.19

P/E Ratio = Offer Price / EPS
         = $89.19 / $0.45
         = 199.58x
```

**What it means:** 
- The seller receives a valuation multiple of 199.58x earnings at the offer price
- This is lower than the current market P/E of 343.05x, meaning the offer represents a more reasonable valuation multiple
- The premium ($20.58/share) compensates for the lower multiple relative to current market expectations

**Comparison:**
- **Seller Has**: 343.05x (current market P/E - very high, reflecting growth expectations)
- **Seller Gets**: 199.58x (offer price P/E - still high but more reasonable)

---

### 3. **Debt/EBITDA Ratio: 5.23x**

**Calculation:**
```
Debt: $132.97M
EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A
       = $10.15M + ($509.40M × 3%)
       = $10.15M + $15.28M
       = $25.43M

Debt/EBITDA = $132.97M / $25.43M
            = 5.23x
```

**What it means:**
- This is the **same as Seller Has** (5.23x)
- Operating metrics (debt, EBITDA) do NOT change with the offer price
- The company's leverage ratio remains the same regardless of what price shareholders receive
- This represents the company's financial health at the offer valuation

**Key Insight:** The offer price doesn't affect the company's operations or debt levels - those stay constant.

---

### 4. **EBITDA/Interest: 4.78x**

**Calculation:**
```
EBITDA: $25.43M
Interest Expense = Debt × Interest Rate
                = $132.97M × 4%
                = $5.32M

EBITDA/Interest = $25.43M / $5.32M
               = 4.78x
```

**What it means:**
- This is the **same as Seller Has** (4.78x)
- Operating metrics (EBITDA, interest expense) do NOT change with the offer price
- Shows the company can cover its interest payments 4.78 times over
- Represents interest coverage ratio at the offer valuation

**Key Insight:** The company's ability to service debt doesn't change based on the offer price.

### 5. **Debt/Capitalization: 1.08%**

**Calculation:**
```
Current Market Cap: $9.39B
Offer Value (Total Consideration): $12.20B
Debt: $132.97M

At Offer Valuation:
Total Capitalization = Debt + Offer Value
                     = $132.97M + $12.20B
                     = $12.33B

Debt/Capitalization = (Debt / Total Capitalization) × 100%
                    = ($132.97M / $12.33B) × 100%
                    = 1.08%
```

**What it means:**
- This is **different from Seller Has** (15.76%)
- Shows leverage at the **offer valuation** (not current market cap)
- Lower percentage because offer value ($12.20B) is higher than current market cap ($9.39B)
- Indicates the company appears less leveraged at the offer price

**Comparison:**
- **Seller Has**: 15.76% (using current market cap of $9.39B)
- **Seller Gets**: 1.08% (using offer value of $12.20B)

**Key Insight:** The higher offer price makes the company appear less leveraged because the denominator (total capitalization) is larger.

---

### 6. **Debt (Net of Cash)/Capitalization: 0.12%**

**Calculation:**
```
Net Debt = Debt - Cash
         = $132.97M - $117.91M
         = $15.06M

Total Capitalization = $12.33B (from above)

Net Debt/Capitalization = (Net Debt / Total Capitalization) × 100%
                        = ($15.06M / $12.33B) × 100%
                        = 0.12%
```

**What it means:**
- Shows net leverage position at offer valuation
- Very low percentage because Lattice has significant cash ($117.91M)
- Net debt is only $15.06M after accounting for cash
- Even lower than Seller Has (1.78%) due to higher offer valuation

**Key Insight:** Lattice has a strong cash position, making net leverage very low.

### 7. **Book Values**

#### **Debt: $132.97M**
- Same as Seller Has
- Debt stays with the company (NVIDIA assumes it after acquisition)
- Not something the seller "gets" - it's transferred to the buyer

#### **Common Stock and Retained Earnings: N/A**
- Seller receives **cash**, not equity
- They no longer own the company's equity
- N/A because they're selling their equity position

#### **Market Value of Shares Outstanding: $12.20B**
- This is the **total consideration** received
- Calculation: Offer Price × Shares Outstanding
- = $89.19 × 136,786,394 shares
- = $12.20 billion

## Key Principles

### 1. **Operating Metrics Don't Change**
- EBITDA, debt, interest expense remain the same regardless of offer price
- These reflect the company's actual operations
- That's why Debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/Interest are the same as Seller Has

### 2. **Valuation Metrics Change**
- P/E ratio changes because it's based on offer price vs. current price
- Debt/Capitalization changes because it uses offer value instead of market cap
- These reflect what the seller receives in terms of valuation multiples

### 3. **Cash Consideration**
- Seller receives cash, not equity
- Total consideration = $12.20B
- This is what Lattice shareholders "get" - cash at $89.19 per share

- ✅ Company operating ratios (unchanged - reflect actual operations)
